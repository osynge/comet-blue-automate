This application would not be possible without the work of [Torsten Tr√§nkner for documenting the Comet Blue](https://www.torsten-traenkner.de/wissen/smarthome/heizung.php) and [Micah Wylde for writing rumble a Rust Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) central module library](https://github.com/mwylde/rumble). Much of this documentation comes from Torsten's blog.
